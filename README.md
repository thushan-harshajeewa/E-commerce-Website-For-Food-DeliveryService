## 🔁 Connecting Frontend to Backend

Make sure the frontend can communicate with the Django backend.

1. In `/frontend/.env`, add:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
```

2. Install CORS middleware in Django:

```bash
pip install django-cors-headers
```

3. Update `backend/settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS += ['corsheaders']
MIDDLEWARE.insert(0, 'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware')
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:5173",
]
```
